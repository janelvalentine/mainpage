            <p>
              This painting is a reflection of me being reflected multiple
              times. Its about how I act when I'm around different people. How I
              tend to be more friendly with people i just met. Or I am more shy
              when it comes to distant family members. The black clothing
              represnts dominance. To show I am grounded. I am in control of
              what I show people.

              This painting is a self portrait conveying the feeling of
              forgetting childhood. The older you get the little things like
              childhood friends and TV shows are often forgotten. Here I have
              forgotten my childhood Monkey. He is jumping out at me like a jack
              in a box, However I'm not surprised in this painting. I had
              forgotten the significance he had in my childhood.

              This drawing is about being trapped in my mind and a space.
              Sometimes life can feel repetitive. Waking up and going to school,
              work then home. Being drained of energy. I think of ways of how I
              can get out of this show I call my life right now. How I can try
              and change something so its not the same as yesterday. Thinking of
              ways I can benefit my career starting at this age. My knuckle is
              only peeking out a bit only for the simple fact that I am close to
              being out. Out of my head, Out of the repetition of the days.

              This is based on the feeling of alcohol. the colors and
              environment tend to be fused together. That's why I made the color
              palette somewhat cohesive. The background has a see through feel
              to it and the movement of the pink shade through the background to
              the foreground.

              Monkey was a childhood stuffed monkey of mines. He was very
              important to my childhood and is a key part of who I am today.
              This is the story of how I lost him. I created this in the mindset
              of 6 year old me. wishing I had created a missing Poster for him.
              Maybe I could have gotten him back. However he is now safe in my
              thoughts and heart.

              People usually don't take fears of bugs seriously. I used to be
              one of those people. Until I realized I'm afraid of ladybugs
              myself. It's such a little thing but a huge thing to me. In this
              painting I am laying down in the grass. Ladybugs tend to crawl on
              anything and everything. So I have a couple tangled in my curls
              and on my face as well. Most of the time when I see ladybugs I
              don't Freak out. Which is why I don't look frightened in the pose
              more uncomfortable

              This flower is called Flor de Maga. This is also the Puerto Rican
              national flower. What's jumping out of it isn't just a flog. This
              is called a Coqui; Another Puerto Rico National animal. These
              together is like an omega of Puerto Rico, which is what I wanted
              to show. This is my culture and a big part of my identity. Black
              in my culture is equal to dominance. In this painting it means the
              same thing. Of how strong I am attracted to my nationality.

              Puerto Rico's national animal is a Coqui frog. It's called Coqui
              because its the sound it makes. "Coqui" "Coqui" "Coqui." If you
              was to ever roam the street of Puerto Rico at night or happen to
              be in their forest. You will hear it. It's rare to actually see
              one, and even hold one. When you catch one or appear to be in your
              hand it means luck. They are small creatures in the forest
              blending in with its tan skin. I used Lino Print to create this
              piece because I needed to convey the details in my hands and how
              much focus should go toward actually seeing a Coqui.
