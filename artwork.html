            Being controlled comes from being a kid. That's how we learned what
            was right from wrong, How we learned our manners. When your a
            teenager, we feel entitled to not being a kid anymore. So our
            parents let us free to learn from our mistakes. For me, My mom still
            feels she need to make decisions for me. In this painting i am
            walking into an elevator with no space but me. The hands are
            signifying my parents and family member still trying to grasp me. I
            am confident purple with its significance of royalty. I am ready to
            take on the world and get older.

            This painting is a reflection of me being reflected multiple times.
            It's about how I act when I'm around different people. How I tend to
            be more friendly with people i just met. Or I am more shy when it
            comes to distant family members. I am wearing black in the main
            reflection to show dominance in the fact that no matter what version
            or how I am acting in any situation, it's my face, it is me. I am
            dominating my body. When they all add up it all equals to me. I am
            also barefooted for that exact reason. To show I am grounded . I am
            in control of what I show people.

            This painting is a self portrait conveying the feeling of forgetting
            childhood. The older you get the little things like childhood
            friends and TV shows are often forgotten. Here I have forgotten my
            childhood Monkey. He was so dear to me, more like a Best friend than
            just a bear. He is jumping out at me like a jack in a box, However
            I'm not surprised in this painting. I had forgotten the significance
            he had in my childhood. The light focuses on him because he was
            important to me at a time in my life. And up until I lost him I
            couldn't be without him.

            In a few of my paintings Monkey features in. In my mind his story
            would live forever. Here he finally makes it back to where he
            belongs. In the forest. Although he is a stuffed Monkey he feels
            real to me. Therefore he is hanging from a real tree in a real
            forest. The pink highlights are for the surrealist feel along with
            the red trees.

            A moment when childhood and connects with now. When getting older
            you tend to realize how much you miss your childhood self. When I
            was younger I was constantly thinking about the future. This artwork
            is portrayed with bright colors and an imagined dream-like feel of a
            sunset. Two suns for two lives with bright futures. The shadow
            figures show how eager younger me is to see older me.

            Puerto Rico's national animal is a Coqui frog. It's called Coqui
            because it's the sound it makes. "Coqui" "Coqui" "Coqui." If you was
            to ever roam the streets of Puerto Rico at night or happen to be in
            their forest. You will hear it. It's rare to actually see one, and
            even hold one. When you catch one or appear to be in your hand it
            means luck. They are small creatures in the forest blending in with
            its tan skin. I used Lino Print to create this piece because I
            needed to convey the details in the hands and how much focus should
            go toward actually seeing a Coqui.

            This drawing is about being trapped in my mind and a space.
            Sometimes life can feel repetitive. Waking up and going to school,
            work then home. Being drained of energy. Walking into the same
            Projects I call home everyday. Past the group of men that try to
            talk to 17 year old me. I think of ways of how I can get out of this
            show I call my life right now. How I can try and change something so
            it's not the same as yesterday. Thinking of ways I can benefit my
            career starting at this age. So when I think where I am 10 years
            from now it's not in the same Projects I dreamed of getting out of.
            My knuckle is only peeking out a bit only for the simple fact that I
            am close to being out. Out of my head, Out of the repetition of the
            days, Out of the Projects I was born and raised in.

            This flower is called Flor de Maga. This is also the Puerto Rican
            national flower. What's jumping out of it isn't just a flog. This is
            called a Coqui; Another Puerto Rico National animal. These together
            are like an omega of Puerto Rico, which is what I wanted to show.
            This is my culture and a big part of my identity. Black in my
            culture is equal to dominance. In this painting it means the same
            thing. Of how strong I am attracted to my nationality.

            This is based on the feeling of alcohol. the colors and environment
            tend to be fused together. That's why I made the color palette
            somewhat cohesive. The background has a see through feel to it and
            the movement of the pink shade through the background to the
            foreground.

            People usually don't take fears of bugs seriously. I used to be one
            of those people. Until I realized I'm afraid of ladybugs myself.
            It's such a little thing but a huge thing to me. I sometimes catch
            myself staring at them not knowing what to do or how to handle them.
            I usually find them when I'm at the park. In this painting I am
            laying down in the grass. Ladybugs tend to crawl on anything and
            everything. So I have a couple tangled in my curls and on my face as
            well. Most of the time when I see ladybugs I don't Freak out. Which
            is why I don't look frightened in the pose more uncomfortable

            A moment between me and my twin sister at age 5. Me and her had our
            differences but our curls were never one of them.

            Monkey was a childhood stuffed monkey of mine. He was very important
            to my childhood and is a key part of who I am today. This is the
            story of how I lost him. I created this in the mindset of 6 year old
            me. wishing I had created a missing Poster for him. Maybe I could
            have gotten him back. However he is now safe in my thoughts and
            heart.
